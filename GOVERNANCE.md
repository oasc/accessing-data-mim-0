The Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) are governed by [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/about/).

Governance includes:
- External Contributors
- Working Groups
- Council of Cities

## External Contributors

The Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms community adheres to the following principles:
* Open: as little restrictions as possible for anyone to reuse adapt the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms to their context
* Welcoming: as a community we want to make it easier for new users to become contributors
* Respectful: ideas and contributions are accepted according to their alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles

We appreciate contributions in the form of feedback, issues and pull requests.
We intend to respond to each contribution if and when possible, but may not always have the capacity to do so.

The governance of the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms is **not** open.

This means contributors will not always receive feedback on if & why their contribution was considered, accepted, or rejected.

## Working Groups: Development version

The development version of the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms is maintained by a working group.

Participation in the working group is **exclusively** open to:
* OASC members 
* OASC strategic partners
* Living-in.EU Technical working group members
* External experts that are invited by the working group for ad hoc consultation

The working group member list is not public.
